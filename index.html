            A major milestone for SpaceX and NASA
            The goal of the Crew Dragon spaceship is to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station.

            NASA hasn't been able to transport astronauts on its own spaceships since July 2011, when its space
            shuttle
            completed its final flight. Since then, the agency has relied exclusively on Russia to ferry its
            astronauts
            to and from orbit in Soyuz spacecraft. To develop new American-made spacecraft, NASA launched the
            Commercial
            Crew program: a competition between private companies for billions of dollars' worth of government
            contracts. Of about a dozen entrants, only SpaceX and Boeing passed NASA's muster.
